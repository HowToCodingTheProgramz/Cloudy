## A CPP Repo which dives into win32 and OpenGL

This repository dives into my longer running series which deals with C++ and explores the win32 GDI "old-skool" style of getting stuff onto the screen.
Wel experiment with OpenGL and mess with the windowing system to exploit some undocumented features of the OS to get some pretty stuff on the screen.
